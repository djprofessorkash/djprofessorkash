Welcome to my GitHub page! My name's Aakash, but you can call me _Kash_! 😁

I am an experienced machine learning developer and software engineering professional with career foci in design thinking, rapid prototyping, artificial intelligence, data ethics, and multi-domain collaboration. 

I currently serve as the adjunct professor of data science at Dominican University of California as part of our Applied Computer Science program and work to reshape how data science is codified and taught to humankind. 

I'm always looking for new projects and opportunities to get involved with creatively ambitious institutions, companies, and people – if you're looking for an equally ambitious and creative technologist at the intersection of data and design, let's connect! 🗣
